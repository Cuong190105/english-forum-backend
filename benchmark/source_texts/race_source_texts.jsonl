Though aging is considered as one of the most unavoidable occurrence in one's life, it is not entirely the thing. You just need to know that you can deal with it in your life. For example, if you are willing to spend a considerable amount of money to make yourself look young again, then you can try eye lifts. However, if you are more of the money-conscious type, then you should decide to go for eye creams which bring the same results but with lower prices.\nDespite of the advantages of using eye creams, however, there is a disadvantage in trying them. This is due to the hundreds of brands o eye creams being marketed at present. If you do not know how to choose the best eye cream in the countless brands available, then you might fall victim to eye creams that do not really fulfill their promised effects.\nWhat's good is that looking for the best eye cream does not involve too much effort. You just have to look for eye cream reviews to know how a product performs and if it lives up to its promises. If you have a dermatologist , then you can ask for advice. If you have none, however, then you can just browse on the net for the best cream for your needs.\nIn searching for eye cream reviews, look for those with reviews based on the results of product testing. Doing so can ensure you that you are not basing your decision on fake review sites that are only made to build up an image of a certain product. Follow these tips and guidelines and you are sure to finally spot the best eye cream that can solve your aging problem.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

They found to their amazement that modern forest and savanna elephants are as distinct from each other as Asian elephants and mammoths.\nThe scientists used detailed genetic analysis to prove that the African savanna elephant and the African forest elephant have been distinct species for several million years. The divergence of the two species took place around the time of the divergence of Asian elephants and woolly mammoths. This result amazed all the scientists. There has long been debate in the scientific community that the two might be separate species, but this is the most convincing scientific evidence so far that they are indeed different species.\nPreviously, many naturalists believed that African savanna elephants and African forest elephants were two populations of the same species, despite the elephants' significant size differences.

Just imagine you are in front of a camera --hold your head high, look straight into the mirror and smile. Keep practicing until you find out your most attractive smiling face.\n2. Choose your color wisely. In yearbook photos, lots of people look good in darker colors because they draw attention to the face. Generally, white often isn't the best choice because it can make your skin look a bit gray, especially if you're pale. Besides, stay away from super -bright colors ( bright yellow, bright blue) unless you're really sure they make you look perfect.\n3. Avoid unnecessary details. Busy patterns draw attention to themselves in yearbook photos, not to your face and smile. Save them for your everyday fashion experiments. Besides, have your clothes prepared for the day when the yearbook photo is taken. The last thing you want to do is pick out the perfect thing to wear, only to find that it's in the laundry.\n4. Avoid big changes to your appearance. Big changes may not turn out the way you hope. Leave some time to do your hair, such as combing  it up right before the yearbook photo is taken.

Some British scientists have recently solved this mystery.\nIt turns out that roots have special hairs that tie them into the soil and help them grow their way past obstacles, a team at the John Inners Center in Norwich reports in the February 29 issue of Journal Science.\n\"The key is in the fuzzy coat of hairs on the roots of plants,\" says professor Liam Dolan. \"We have found a growth control system that enables these hairs to find their way and to become longer when their path is clear.\"\nRoot hairs explore the soil in much the same way a person would feel their way in the dark. If they come across an obstacle, they make their way around until they can continue growing in an opening. In the meantime, the plant is held in place as the hairs grip the soil.\nThe hairs are guided by a clever chemical trick. A protein  at the tip of the root hairs called RHD2 helps them to take calcium  from the soil. Calcium makes the hairs grow, and produce more RHD2, and take more calcium.\nBut when an obstacle blocks the hair's path, or the hair reaches the surface of the soil, the cycle is broken and growth starts in another direction.\nThis system gives plants the flexibility to explore a complex environment and to live in even the most unpromising soils, says Dolan.\nIn poor soils such as in parts of Australia and Africa, native plants have adapted by producing enormous numbers of root hairs. A better understanding of this adaptation will allow scientists to develop hairy rooted crops that can grow in unfriendly environments.\nAccording to Dolan, \"Research in the John Inners Center is taking a breeding approach to increase hair length in wheat but it will be some time before new cultivars  are developed.\"", "split": "train", "level": ""}

To make this possible,a percentage of profits should be set aside for this purpose. But when a company must take lifelong responsibility for its employees,it may suffer from a commercial disadvantage due to higher employee costs.\nAnother way of solving the problem is to return the responsibility to the individual. This means each person must save during his working years to pay for his years of retirement. This does not seem a very fair model since some people have enough trouble paying for their daily life without trying to earn extra to cover their retirement years. This means the government might have to step in to care for the poor.\nIn addition,the government could take the responsibility for the care of the old. This could be financed through government taxes to increase the level of pensions.

The government can seldom afford to care for the old,particularly when it is busy trying to care for the young.\nOne further solution is that the government or social organizations establish some workplaces especially for the old where they are independent.\nTo sum up,all these options have advantages and disadvantages.

The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks  coffee shops spread across the country.\nThe first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle.\nThings really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who _ Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing .\nIn 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The special environment of the espresso( ) bars there caught his eyes. Back in the USA, Schultz created an environment for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable and casual, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Starbucks began opening more stores across the USA. Then the company opened coffee shops in other countries as well. Today, there are more than 16,000 Starbucks coffee shops all over the world.\nHowever, that does not mean Starbucks has not had problems. In fact, many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years. On the one hand, this is because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. On the other hand, stores in some countries closed because the coffee culture there did not match with the \"feel the same everywhere\" environment offered by Starbucks.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

At first a young boy, Manolin, had shared his bad fortune, but after the fortieth luckless day the boy's father told his son to go in another boat. From that time on, Santiago worked alone. The boy loved the old fisherman and always helped him with money and food. Usually, they would talk about the fish they had taken in luckier times or about American baseball after supper, while at night, alone in his cottage, Santiago dreamed of lions on the beaches of Africa, where he had gone years before. _ \nOn the eighty-fifth day, Santiago set off to fish before dawn. Two of his baits  were fresh tunas  the boy had given him, as well as sardines  to cover his hooks. Then he set his lines which went straight down into deep dark water.\nAs the sun rose he saw other boats in toward shore. A bird showed him where dolphins were chasing some flying fish. This time Santiago saw tuna jumping in the sunlight. A small one took the hook on his line. Pulling the fish aboard, the old man thought it a good fortune.\nToward noon a marlin, a common fish in the sea, started eating the bait which was one hundred meters down. Gently the old man played the fish, a big one, as he knew from the weight on the line. At last he struck to settle the hook. The fish did not come out of the surface. Instead, it began to pull the boat to the northwest. The old man followed it. _ \nIt was cold after the sunset. When something took one of his remaining baits, he cut the line with his knife. Once the marlin leaned suddenly, pulling Santiago forward on his face and cutting his cheek. By dawn his left hand was cramped . The fish had headed northward; there was no land in sight. Hungry, he cut pieces from the tuna and chewed them slowly.\nThat morning the fish jumped. Seeing it, Santiago knew he had hooked the biggest marlin he had ever seen. Then the fish went down and turned toward the east. Santiago drank a little water from the bottle during the hot afternoon.\nClose to nightfall a dolphin took the small hook he had rebaited. He lifted it aboard, careful. After he had rested, he cut meat from the dolphin and kept also the two flying fish he found in its stomach. That night he slept. He awoke to feel the line running through his fingers as the fish jumped. Feeding line slowly, he tried to tire the marlin. After the fish slowed its run, he washed his cut hands in sea water and ate one of the flying fish. At sunrise the marlin began to circle. Faint, he worked to bring the big fish nearer with each turn. _ The fish was two feet longer than the boat. No fish like it had ever been seen in Havana harbor.\nAn hour later, he sighted the first shark, a fierce Mako, and it came in fast to chase after the dead marlin. The old man struck the shark with his harpoon. The Mako rolled and sank, carrying the harpoon with it and leaving the marlin bloody. He knew the smell would spread. Watching, he saw two sharks closing in. He struck at one with his knife and watched it sliding down into deep water. The other he killed while it tore at the flesh of the marlin. When the third appeared, he thrust  it with the knife. The other sharks came at sunset. At first he tried to beat them with the tiller  from the boat, but his hands were bleeding and there were too many in the sea. In the darkness, as he steered toward the harbor of Havana, he heard them hitting the boat again and again. But the old man thought only of his steering and his great tiredness.

If  Prof Persaud wants to know why Americans tip in restaurants, he need only ask the first American he meets inprefix = st1 /London.\nAmericans tip in restaurants for one reason, and one reason only: we tip to supplement   the salary of restaurant workers. Quality of service does not enter into it, beyond the fact that one may tip a bit less for poor service, or a little more for good service.\nNot tipping at all in a non-fast-food restaurant is not a choice. In the US, one used to tip about 15 per cent for dining in a family-style restaurant or in an up-market   restaurant. Here, in San FranciscoBayarea restaurants, we are encouraged to tip 20 per cent or more, to help restart workers live in this very expensive area.\nAfter eating at an Italian restart in my city, I left a tip of 20 per cent on the non-tax part of our dinner bill. It was expected. There is nothing more complicated than that about Americastipping in restaurants.\nWard Hoffman,  \nPalo Alto, CA94306,US\n*                *                  *\nFrom Mr. Philip McBride Johnson.\nSir, I agree with most of Raj Persaud's opinion about the doubtful value of tipping, but with one exception. Tips can be very useful when one is a repeat customer or diner.\nIt is only when the tipper is a stranger and likely to remain so that the system does not work to his or her advantage. But frequent a hotel or a restaurant, always tip a bit more, and the difference in service and treatment will be easily felt.\nPhfiip McBnde Johnson,\nGreat Falls, VA22066,US", "split": "train", "level": ""}

{"id": "high14098.txt", "source_text": "Ode to Joy(<<>> ),a 42-episodes TV series, is about five young women living on the 22nd floor of Shanghai's \"Ode to Joy\" high-rise community. They become friends while pursuing love and career advancement. Since its appearance on April 18, Ode to Joy has been praised for its realistic description of the hidden struggles of city life. \"The audience can relate to the characters since their experiences can be traced back to real life too,\" commented the Dahe Daily. \"Even better, female audiences can find themselves in one or two of the characters because the characters _ feminine archetypes  found throughout the society.\"But the idea of following a group of women as they lead a city life is hardly a pioneering concept. In many ways, Ode to Joy resembles American TV series like Sex and the City (1998-2004) and Desperate Housewives (2004-2012). These two series were praised for their feminist themes, but they also employed well-known female archetypes to illustrate the range of dilemmas women face. Deborah A. Macey, a communications professor at Saint Louis University in the US, divides these archetypes up into four ways: the iron maiden, the sex object, the child,and the mother. \"The iron maiden is portrayed as masculine and career-oriented. The sex object owns her sexuality and genuinely loves her body. The child archetype is naive, optimistic, and dim-witted. The mother archetype connects the characters in the series and serves as the dominant storyteller,\" Macey said on the online media forum \"In Media Res\".\nSounds familiar? Yes, these features can be seen in the characters of Ode toJoy. Andy (Liu Tao), for instance, partly embodies the iron maiden role. She's super smart, rational and direct. She moves from the US to Shanghai and takes the position of CFO at a top Chinese company. Fan Shengmei (Jiang Xin) can be seen as the \"mother\" in the series. Despite the fact that she s in charge of her own family issues,she takes her friends under her wing and stands up for them. Qu Xiaoxiao (Wang ziwen), the sexy and beautiful girl born with silver spoon, perfectly illustrates what is bitter-sweet relationship between friends and lovers. With that being said. Ode to Joy doesn't lack creativity. It assigns the \"child\" role to two characters-the straightforward, naive Qiu Yingying (Yang Zi), and the good-tempered, hard-working Guan Ju'er (Qiao Xin).\nBut this category of TV series has its risks. Having five main characters means the drama isn't story-driven but character-driven. \"It's not something you often see in Chinese TV dramas,\" Yuan Zidan, Ode to Joy's screenwriter, told Changjiang Daily. \"But we want to challenge the norms.\"", "split": "train", "level": ""}

The introduction of the solar calendar and Western measurements was both an acknowledgment of their influence and an effort to be accepted by the world order.\nFor a full century, we have had two systems running in parallel. When it comes to the eventual outcome, practicality usually beats all other concerns.

While we are always charged with making sure you have adequate electricity, this summer has caused a particularly serious challenge to the electric grid .\nBecause the heat has been sustained over the entire state with little or no rain or cloud cover, the strain on the electric grid has been greater than ever before.

All of these factors are contributing to very high energy usage this summer.\nAs you probably read in your newspaper or saw on the news, ERCOT has issued appeals for conservation across the state this August.

If the friend that you want to get is male, leave a message that a certain girl would like him to stop by her house later that day. With any luck,her boyfriend will be there. The girl won't know what's going on, and the victim will be so embarrassed that he probably won't leave his home for a month.\nWhen Mom and Dad and your sisters and brothers really begin to annoy you, harmless revenge may be just the way it makes them quiet down for a while. The dinner table is a likely place. Just before the meal begins, throw a handful of raisins   into the food. Wait about five minutes and, after everyone has begun to eat, cover your mouth with your hand and begin to make strange noises. When they ask you what the matter is, point to a raisin and yell. \"Bugs!\" They'll throw their food in the dustbin, jump into the car, and head for McDonald's. That night you'll have your first quiet, peaceful meal in a long time.\nA well-planned revenge does not have it hurt anyone. The object is simply to let other people know that they are beginning to bother you.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Not everyone gets it from Mommy and Daddy. Most have to pay for these activities. Some adults question if high school students should have jobs. \nSome people worry that teens with after-school jobs will struggle to find time for homework. Actually, the responsibility of having a job helps teens prioritize their time. Many jobs take only a couple of  hour shifts on weeknights. According to a survey, 86 percent of high school students have an after-school, weekend or summer job and students who work between 10 and 20 hours per week during the school year have statistically higher grades-point averages than those who do not work at all. Those who work in high school are more likely to work in college, and financing their college education is a top reason for undergraduates to look for employment. Instead of considering jobs a barrier, employment should be looked at as real-world education. \nOther people think that work adds too much stress, which may be somewhat true, but regardless of having a job or not, there is always going to be stress. Better to learn how to deal with busy schedules in a controlled environment like high school than to be out on your own and alone, experiencing stress for the first time. I personally would be more concerned for the teenager who has to become independent without having any familiarity with working.\nThe biggest reason teens should be allowed to work is that it is a healthy way of earning money. My dad told me, \"Having a job is a good way to save up for things you are going to need or want to do. You get a lot more out of things if you are financially responsible for them.\" Kids need the freedom to choose how to spend their money. The sooner they have an income, the sooner they can learn how to use money wisely.

It didn't seem fair.\nBecause Noah was so frustrated  , his dad and teachers made an appointment with the school psychologist. She diagnosed   Noah with a learning disability. Although Noah felt relieved to know what was going on, he was also worried. He didn't like the \"disability\" label. And he was concerned about what it might mean for his future. Would he be able to go to college and study engineering as he'd hoped?\nFor someone diagnosed with a learning disability, it can seem scary at first. But a learning disability doesn't have anything to do with a person's intelligence. After all, such successful people as Walt Disney, Alexander Graham Bell, and Winston Churchill all had learning disabilities.\nLearning disabilities are problems that affect the brain's ability to receive, process, analyze, or store information. These problems can make it difficult for a student to learn as quickly as someone who isn't affected by learning disabilities. The way our brains process information is extremely complex --- it's no wonder things can get messed up sometimes. Take the simple act of looking at a picture, for example: Our brains not only have to form the lines into an image, they also have to recognize what the image stands for, relate that image to other facts stored in our memories, and then store this new information. It's the same thing with speech - we have to recognize the words, interpret the meaning, and figure out the significance of the statement to us. Many of these activities take place in separate parts of the brain, and it's up to our minds to link them all together.\nIf, like Noah, you've been diagnosed with a learning disability, you're not alone. Nearly four million school-age children and teens have learning disabilities, and at least 20% of them have a type of disorder that makes it difficult to focus.\nNo one's exactly sure what causes learning disabilities.

{"id": "high19941.txt", "source_text": "Painting, the execution of forms and shapes on a surface by means of pigment  , has been continuously practiced by humans for some 20,000 years. Together with other activities that may have been ritualistic   but have come to be considered as artistic   (such as music or dance), painting was one of the earliest ways in which man sought to express his own personality and his emerging understanding of an existence beyond the material world. Unlike music and dance, however, examples of early forms of painting have survived to the present day. And painting, like other arts, exhibits universal qualities that make it easy for viewers of all nations and civilizations to understand and appreciate.\nThe major extant examples of early painting anywhere in the world are found in Western Europe and the Soviet Union. But some 5,000 years ago, the areas in which important paintings were executed shifted to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and neighboring regions. Therefore, Western shared a European cultural tradition ----the Middle East and Mediterranean Basin and, later, the countries of the New World.\nWestern painting is in general distinguished by its concentration on the representation of the human figure, whether in the heroic context of antiquity   or the religious context of the early Christian and medieval   world. The Renaissance extended this tradition through a close examination of the natural world and an investigation of balance, harmony, and perspective in the visible world, linking painting to the developing sciences of anatomy   and optics  . The first real break from figurative painting came with the growth of landscape painting in the 17th and 18th centuries. The landscape and figurative traditions developed together in the 19th century in an atmosphere that was increasingly concerned with \"painterly\" qualities of the interaction of light and color1 and the expressive qualities of paint handling. In the 20th century these interests contributed to the development of a third major tradition in Western painting, abstract painting, which sought to uncover and express the true nature of paint and painting through action and form.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Long arms. Thin waist. Flat stomach.\"\nOn this point, Greitens departs a bit. \"You can't make a lot of physical assumptions,\" says the author of \"The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL.\" There are SEALs who are 5 feet 4 and SEALs who are 6 feet 5, Greitens says. In his training group, he adds, there were college football boys who couldn't hack it; those who survived were most often men in good shape, but they also had a willingness to show their concerns in favor of the mission.\nThe shooter's probably not the crew-cut , neatly shaven ideal we've come to expect from American fighting forces. \"He's bearded, rough-looking, like a street naughty boy,\" Marcinko supposes. \"You don't want to stick out.\" Marcinko calls it \"modified grooming standards.\"\nHis hands will be calloused , Smith says, or just rough enough,\" as Marcinko puts it. And \"he's got frag in him somewhere,\" Marcinko says, using the battlefield shorthand for \"fragments\" of bullets or explosive devices. This will not have been the shooter's first adventure.
