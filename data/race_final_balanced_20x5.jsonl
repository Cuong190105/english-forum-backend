{"id": "high7211.txt", "source_text": "A recent study of ancient and modern elephants has come up with the unexpected conclusion that the African elephant is divided into two distinct  species.\nThe discovery was made by researchers at York and Harvard Universities when they were examining the genetic relationship between the ancient woolly mammoth and mastodon to modern elephants -- the Asian elephant, African forest elephant, and African savanna elephant.\nOnce they obtained DNA sequences  from two fossils , mammoths,and mastodons the team compared them with DNA from modern elephants. They found to their amazement that modern forest and savanna elephants are as distinct from each other as Asian elephants and mammoths.\nThe scientists used detailed genetic analysis to prove that the African savanna elephant and the African forest elephant have been distinct species for several million years. The divergence of the two species took place around the time of the divergence of Asian elephants and woolly mammoths. This result amazed all the scientists. There has long been debate in the scientific community that the two might be separate species, but this is the most convincing scientific evidence so far that they are indeed different species.\nPreviously, many naturalists believed that African savanna elephants and African forest elephants were two populations of the same species, despite the elephants' significant size differences. The savanna elephant has an average shoulder height of 3.5 metres while the forest elephant has an average shoulder height of 2.5 metres. The savanna elephant weighs between six and seven tons, roughly double the weight of the forest elephant. But the fact that they look so different does not necessarily mean they are different species. However the proof lay in the analysis of the DNA.\nAlfred Roca, assistant professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois, said, \"We now have to treat the forest and savanna elephants as two different units for conservation purposes. Since 1950,all African elephants have been conserved as one species. Now that we know the forest and savanna elephants are two very distinctive animals, the forest elephant should become a bigger priority  for conservation purposes.\"", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Past Simple", "topic_category": "tenses_aspects"}

{"id": "high827.txt", "source_text": "Have you ever wondered why the roots of the plants always know which way to grow--into the soil but not above it? Some British scientists have recently solved this mystery.\nIt turns out that roots have special hairs that tie them into the soil and help them grow their way past obstacles, a team at the John Inners Center in Norwich reports in the February 29 issue of Journal Science.\n\"The key is in the fuzzy coat of hairs on the roots of plants,\" says professor Liam Dolan. \"We have found a growth control system that enables these hairs to find their way and to become longer when their path is clear.\"\nRoot hairs explore the soil in much the same way a person would feel their way in the dark. If they come across an obstacle, they make their way around until they can continue growing in an opening. In the meantime, the plant is held in place as the hairs grip the soil.\nThe hairs are guided by a clever chemical trick. A protein  at the tip of the root hairs called RHD2 helps them to take calcium  from the soil. Calcium makes the hairs grow, and produce more RHD2, and take more calcium.\nBut when an obstacle blocks the hair's path, or the hair reaches the surface of the soil, the cycle is broken and growth starts in another direction.\nThis system gives plants the flexibility to explore a complex environment and to live in even the most unpromising soils, says Dolan.\nIn poor soils such as in parts of Australia and Africa, native plants have adapted by producing enormous numbers of root hairs. A better understanding of this adaptation will allow scientists to develop hairy rooted crops that can grow in unfriendly environments.\nAccording to Dolan, \"Research in the John Inners Center is taking a breeding approach to increase hair length in wheat but it will be some time before new cultivars  are developed.\"", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Present Simple", "topic_category": "tenses_aspects"}

He studied how to put a pipe inside the heart to measure the pressure inside and decide whether a patient needs surgery.\nExperiments had been done on horses before, so he wanted to try with human patients. But it was not permitted because the experiment was considered too dangerous.\nNot giving up, Forssmann decided to experiment on himself. He anaesthetized   his own arm and made a cut, putting the pipe 30 centimeters into his vein. He then climbed two floors to the X-ray room before pushing the pipe all the way into his heart.\n2. Barry Marshall (Nobel prize winner in 2005)\nMost doctors in the mid-20th century believed that _ was down to stress, spicy food or an unusually large amount of stomach acid. But in 1979 an Australian scientist named Robin Warren found that the disease might be related to a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori.\nSo he teamed up with his colleague, Barry Marshall, to continue the study. When their request to experiment on patients was denied, Marshall bravely drank some of the bacteria. Five days later, he lost his appetite and soon was vomiting each morning - he indeed had gastritis.\n3.

But the number of people who buy newspapers has been falling for years. And this traditional business model had not worked very well on the Internet, especially in a bad economy.\nMany newspaper companies have large debts from buying other papers. Some papers have recently closed or declared bankruptcy or reduced their operations. \nNewspapers are looking for new ways to reinvent themselves and new ways to earn money. That includes giving new consideration to an old idea-charging for at least some of the material that most papers now publish online for free.\nInternet access to newspapers means that more people may read the news, which is good for society. But good reporting costs money. The question is how much people are willing to pay for news that they have got used to receiving for free.\nThe look of American newspapers changed after USA Today arrived in 1982. Most of the stories were short. There was heavy use of color1 and images. People who compared it to television did not necessarily mean that as praise. But the new design succeeded and influenced many other papers.\nNow newspapers are looking to redesign themselves for an increasingly online world. Millions of people would rather read papers like USA Today and The New York Times for free on the Web than pay for a printed version.

The following are some examples of body decoration from around the world.\nIn many parts of Africa, it is thought that an attractive girl should have really shinny skin.\nOn Bali, a little island in Indonesia, they believe that a beautiful woman or handsome man must have perfectly straight, flat teeth. The Balinese believe that teeth with pointed edges make you look like an ugly wild animal. So when a girl or boy becomes a teenager, he or she is taken to a special person in their village who will file off teeth points to make them smooth and flat. There is no anesthetic and this tooth filing is really painful. It is a kind of test. If you can stand it without screaming or crying too much, then you are thought ready to become an adult.\nIn Myanmar, there is a small group of people who are called the \"Papaung\". They believe that a woman can only be really beautiful if she has a long neck. I mean a VERY long neck. Now you might think that you are either born with a long or short neck and that there's nothing whatever you can do about it. But you would be wrong! At around the age of 5, a Papaung girl has heavy metal rings fitted around her neck, tightly between the chin and shoulders. Each year more rings are added and very, very slowly their weight pushes the shoulders down, in this way making the neck look longer. A Papaung woman will wear her neck rings all her life, never once taking them off.\nSo now I'm sure you will all agree that different people have different ideas about what is beautiful.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Passive (all tenses)", "topic_category": "passive_causative"}

Imaging what an amazing fun it is to watch an entire herd splashing  around and rolling in the river just feet in front of you!\nThis opportunity is available through a programme designed for visitors and volunteers to work in the world-famous government-run elephant orphanage in Pinnawela, Sri Lanka. The orphanage is regarded as one of the largest centers of its kind in the world, with one of the most successful captive breeding  programmes for Asian elephants.\nPinnawela Orphanage is situated in the hills of central Sri Lanka. It was established in 1975 by the Sir Lanka Wildlife Department. The orphanage's 24 acres  are a home for the many baby elephants found in the jungle without their mothers. In most of these cases the mothers had either died or been killed. Baby elephants cared for by the orphanage are released into the wild when they reach a certain age.\nThe volunteers' working hours are quite short so there is plenty of time to sightsee and explore. The volunteer work consists mainly of the day-to-day aspects of running the orphanage, rather than more specialized research-based work.\nThe volunteers' main duties are cleaning the elephant homes in the morning (hard, muddy work!) and bathing some of the smaller elephants. Some elephants are overly large or have not been tamed or trained to a satisfactory level. However there are still enough opportunities to have full hands-on contact safely.\nWhile the mahouts are bathing the larger elephants, you will have a chance to relax by the river, chat with the mahouts and watch the elephants play and interact with humans and each other.

It is the day when everyone goes back home to spend the day with his family, to have the traditional Thanksgiving dinner of roast turkey, to talk about old times.\nThis is a story of Thanksgiving Day and of one man's efforts, under rather special circumstances, to carry on these traditions.\nOld Pete took his seat this day on his usual bench in Union Square. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years, Pete had taken this same seat exactly at one o'clock, and each time the same pleasant thing had happened. But this time Pete had come here more from habit than from hunger.\nCertainly today Pete was not hungry. He had just had a dinner so enormous that he could hardly breathe. The buttons on his ragged shirt and coat were about to burst. He was so full of soup, oysters, roast turkey, apple pie, ice cream, and a dozen other rich foods that the November breeze and the first light fall of snow felt cool and pleasant to his face.\nThe meal had been completely unexpected. He had been passing one of the large homes on Fifth Avenue, where there lived two rich old ladies. It seems that it was their custom each Thanksgiving to place a servant at the front entrance with orders to bring in the first hungry looking person that passed and then give him a Thanksgiving dinner of everything he could eat. On this particular Thanksgiving Day, Pete had passed, the servant had brought him in, and, before Pete knew it, he was being served like a king with more food than he could eat.\nPete sat on the bench now, hardly able to move. He happened to look to the left and there in the distance he saw the Old Gentleman coming toward him. He wanted to get up and run, but he was so full of food that he stayed right there. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years, the Old Gentleman had come here, and found Pete on this same bench, and then taken him to a restaurant and bought him a Thanksgiving dinner. It was a kind of tradition which the Old Gentleman, who had no family and lived alone, had tried to continue. The old man was tall and thin and sixty years old. He was aristocratic looking and he always dressed in black. His hair was whiter and thinner than it had been the year before, and he leaned more heavily on his cane than he used to.\n\"How do you do!\" said the Old Gentleman. \"I am glad to see that the changes of another year have permitted you to move in health through this beautiful world.\"\nEach time the Old Gentleman had said exactly this same thing. It was part of the tradition. Old Pete, too, began to feel as though he himself was now a part of the tradition, and he therefore did not have the courage to tell the old man that he had already eaten. This dinner seemed to mean so much to the Old Gentleman.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Old Pete at last. \"I'll go with you gladly. I'm very hungry sir.\"\nTogether the Old Gentleman and Pete walked south to the same restaurant where each year Pete had his Thanksgiving dinner. They sat at the same table. The Old Gentleman seemed pleased and happy. When the waiter brought dish after dish of food to Pete, the Old Gentleman sat quietly and smiled. Under the circumstance, Pete had to eat. It was part of the tradition, and so he ate like a hero. Soup, oysters, roast turkey, pie, he ate everything, although when he entered the restaurant even the smell of more food almost made him sick. At last Pete leaned back with the battle won.\n\"Thank you sir,\" he said, with some effort, \" for a fine dinner.\"\nThey parted as they did each year at the door, the Old Gentleman going south, Pete north.\nAround the corner, Pete stopped for a moment, felt a terrible pain in his stomach, then fell to the sidewalk unconscious. A little later an ambulance came. In the hospital they discovered that he had had an attack of indigestion.\nAn hour later, another ambulance brought the Old Gentleman to the same hospital. At first they thought it was also indigestion but later one of the nurses said,\n\"That nice old gentleman over there-- you wouldn't think that it was a case of starvation.

I could remember standing in the heat of the afternoon, with sweat pouring down my brow and the hot, burning sun against my face. I reminded myself then and there that in the cold of the winter I would wish I had this heat.\n         I was grateful for the extremes. Without the extremes in my life, I would never appreciate the days when things were just right. Without the extremes, life would be boring.\n         It's being pushed to one of the extremes that makes us appreciate the middle more. Health challenges remind us that we need to pay more attention to how we live. Financial extremes remind us that when things go smoothly it's also time to save for raining days. ks5u\n         I've come to the conclusion that all too often I find a reason not to be happy with where I am at that moment.\n         Whether it's hot or cold, good health or bad, in the money or out of it, I always\nwant it to be different.\n         I'm tired of being \"Under the Weather!\"", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "as…as", "topic_category": "comparisons"}
{"id": "high6564.txt", "source_text": "The following are letters to the editor of a school newspaper\nDear editor,\nI'd like to express my opinion about grades. Students should be allowed to study without worrying about grades. Fortunately, most educators are becoming aware of the fact that students have different interests and abilities. I understand that grades are useful, but grades often limit creativity. Competing for better grades causes many students to turn down opportunities to pursue music, dramatics and sports. Grades force an arbitrary  standard of success on everyone. I do not demand as some extremists do, that grades be removed immediately. However, I do believe that less emphasis should be placed on grades. I hope that someday grades will become optional at Village High School.\nMagdalena Smith\nDrama Club\nDear editor,\nI'd like to say something about grades. Let's face the facts about grades. Grades perform three basic functions. First, grades motivate students to work at their highest level of competence. Second, they act as a reward for hardworking students and as a punishment to students who do not work hard. Finally, grades are used as an effective standard by which to measure student achievement. Good grades help students to get jobs and to get into university. I've spoken with a number of students who have jobs, and most of them say that they were hired primarily on the basis of their grades. My grades helped me land a part-time job and will help me get into university next year. I think grades are extremely important at Village High School.\nSimon Harper\nScience Club", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "as…as", "topic_category": "comparisons"}
{"id": "high15013.txt", "source_text": "Chinese Emoji   Circles Globe\n\"Funny\", a made-in-China emoji, seems to have recently moved beyond China. Now, it is more than an emoji, but a cultural expansion.\nReaching Global Markets\nA series of \"funny\" emoji-based bolsters   have attracted the attention of Japanese customers. Even if one bolster is more than three times as expensive as in China, it doesn't kill their desires to buy it. One Japanese customer Miki said, \"They are just so cute and I bought three bolsters at one time for my family. And every time I see them, my mood just brightens suddenly.\"\nA Japanese netizen Kiro Kara said, \"I think the emoji implies very complicated meanings. My dad will send it when he doesn't agree with someone but he has to say something and behave politely.\"\nAddition to Domestic Social Media\nCompared with Japanese impressions of the \"funny\" emoji, Chinese netizens prefer to use the emoji to tease one another on social media.\nOne commonly seen online comment is, \"We strongly suggest stopping the usage of the emoji. Because every time other people send me the emoji, I feel very uncomfortable and consider myself as a fool.\"\nRegarded as the most popular emoji, the \"funny\" emoji has received much attention since its release in 2013. In fact, the \"funny\" emoji is the updated version of its original one; \"funny\" has a smiley mouth, two eyebrows and a naughty look. All these characteristics present users a sense of satire  .\nIn Everyday Use Abroad\nIt's not the first time the Chinese emoji takes the world stage. Earlier this year, one emoji from the Chinese basketball celebrity Yao Ming has been spread through the Middle East region. In a city in southern Egypt, Yao's smiling emoji has appeared frequently in local traffic signs to remind people the road ahead is one-way. Many locals do not know Yao Ming but are familiar with his emoji and nickname \"Chinese Funny Face\".\nAs a new online language, emojis have become a necessary part of people's daily life, helping people express their views in a more vivid and precise way. Also, it can help foreigners learn about Chinese culture. But how to properly use \"the fifth innovation in China\" without hurting others and turn them into commercial advantages still need answers.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "as…as", "topic_category": "comparisons"}
{"id": "high8327.txt", "source_text": "There are a lot of things that happen to me in China but would certainly never happen in the US. One of those things is being called \"strong\".\nThe first time was last December. I was walking across the high school campus in Guangzhou where I taught when a student in a gray scarf waved hello. I smiled and waved back, but then she stopped and called my name. \"You're so strong!\" She smiled and pointed at what appeared to be my arm.\nI looked down at my arms. Let's get one thing clear: I'm a very skinny guy. Once, while rehearsing for a high school talent show, I was told by the teacher in charge that I couldn't participate in the men's shirtless dance routine because my visible rig cage  would frighten the audience.\n\"I'm so what?\" \"You're so strong!\" _ repeated. \"Um, thanks!\" I didn't know what else to say, so we both waved goodbye.\nThe next morning I stepped into my oral English classroom only to be greeted instantly by a unanimous  \"Waaa!\" of shock and admiration. \"What?\" I asked. \"You're so strong!\" shouted a boy from the back of the class.\n\"Okay, will someone tell me what that means?\" I was curious as to the real reason for such praise. So I turned to the monitor, gesturing for him to speak.\n\"We just mean, you look very strong today,\" he offered earnestly.\n\"What?! You mean like this?\" I curled my arm like a bodybuilder.\n\"No! But it's so cold, and you're only wearing a shortsleeve shirt.\"\nOh, I got it. My \"strength\" had less to do with my muscle and more to do with my apparent ignorance of the cold weather.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "as…as", "topic_category": "comparisons"}
{"id": "high1324.txt", "source_text": "Nowadays, the increase in the prices of agricultural products is one of the greatest concerns of the people and the government. The government has announced a series of policies  to prevent the prices from rising further. Rising housing prices is still a big concern for the people, but since farm products are needed every day, the increase in their prices has made life very difficult for them.\nMany people may think the increase will help farmers. But have higher prices of farm products really benefited the farmers?\nTake the increase in vegetable prices in the first half of this year for example. Though natural disasters such as droughts and spring frost did not cause the prices of farm products to increase greatly--in fact, prices of some products did not increase at all--vegetables have become dearer by as much as 20 percent compared to that of last year. This means only a small part (or even none) of the extra money that city people have paid to buy farm products has gone to the farmers. The extra cost actually has gone to middlemen.\nAs the fact shows, just increasing prices of farm products will have negative influence on the entire economy. On one hand, the price increase has created some abnormal phenomena, which hurts farmers' interests. On the other hand, resources will enter the agriculture because of the high price of farm products, which would finally create negative effect on the whole economy.\nIn such a case, it would be better to leave the market to decide the prices instead of raising farm products' prices to protect the interests of farmers. Actually, such a way will be better for farmers in the long run.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "as…as", "topic_category": "comparisons"}
