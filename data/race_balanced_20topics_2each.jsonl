{"id": "high7211.txt", "source_text": "A recent study of ancient and modern elephants has come up with the unexpected conclusion that the African elephant is divided into two distinct  species.\nThe discovery was made by researchers at York and Harvard Universities when they were examining the genetic relationship between the ancient woolly mammoth and mastodon to modern elephants -- the Asian elephant, African forest elephant, and African savanna elephant.\nOnce they obtained DNA sequences  from two fossils , mammoths,and mastodons the team compared them with DNA from modern elephants. They found to their amazement that modern forest and savanna elephants are as distinct from each other as Asian elephants and mammoths.\nThe scientists used detailed genetic analysis to prove that the African savanna elephant and the African forest elephant have been distinct species for several million years. The divergence of the two species took place around the time of the divergence of Asian elephants and woolly mammoths. This result amazed all the scientists. There has long been debate in the scientific community that the two might be separate species, but this is the most convincing scientific evidence so far that they are indeed different species.\nPreviously, many naturalists believed that African savanna elephants and African forest elephants were two populations of the same species, despite the elephants' significant size differences. The savanna elephant has an average shoulder height of 3.5 metres while the forest elephant has an average shoulder height of 2.5 metres. The savanna elephant weighs between six and seven tons, roughly double the weight of the forest elephant. But the fact that they look so different does not necessarily mean they are different species. However the proof lay in the analysis of the DNA.\nAlfred Roca, assistant professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois, said, \"We now have to treat the forest and savanna elephants as two different units for conservation purposes. Since 1950,all African elephants have been conserved as one species. Now that we know the forest and savanna elephants are two very distinctive animals, the forest elephant should become a bigger priority  for conservation purposes.\"", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Past Simple", "topic_category": "tenses_aspects"}

There were so many amazing ideas produced on that day.\nWhile some of the ideas were far from perfect, there were many that could be practical like the smart cars which can ease traffic pressure by telling traffic lights of its arrival and also guiding the drivers to the best possible route .\nEmer Beamer, the founder of Unexpect, says the purpose of the project is to introduce children to skills they probably never learn in class. She says that for most part, schools focus on teaching things that they will most likely never need to know again. She believes that for kids to be successful in the world, they should be learning how to be creative, handle new technologies and deal with unexpected situations.\nThough the first global design challenge was relatively small, involving only a few hundred of the two billion youngsters that are bursting with ideas, the next one will be much bigger.

That could rise to 4.5 percent by 2030 and 10 percent by 2050. The African development Bank is raising concerns over the shortage of health insurance and pensions  .\nThe African Development Bank says. \"Aging is highly linked with long-term physical and mental  disability and a number of long-term chronic   conditions.\"\n\"Africa is not well prepared to care for its aging population right now. And it needs to prepare for this fact.\" said Professor Mthuli Ncube. the African Development Bank's chief economist. African nations spend far less on healthcare than developed nations do _  about $26per person per year. Not so many countries have well developed medical aid plans for the elderly, whether they are privately provided plans or indeed government plans. If you look at the pension plans, you will find the pension industries are not well developed in some of the countries.\nProfessor Mthuli Ncube said African governments failed to take action on health insurance\nand pensions because they were busy with economic reforms.\nAnother challenge for Africa is the worsening of informal systems of social protection. That is cash and support from both the extended family and community sources.\n. The African Development Bank recommends governments help carry out health insurance and pension plans. Ncube said African governments didn't have to handle the health insurance burden alone. \"It is not only a must but also an opportunity for private companies to add their bit in this regard\", he said. The report also recommends that African governments consider providing ways of free health services. medications and long-term health care facilities for the elderly.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Reporting verbs", "topic_category": "reported_speech"}

In fact, researchers say, speaking two languages appears to be more important than the level of education in defending against dementias.\nA study in India examined the effect of knowing more than one language in delaying the first signs of several dementias. Researchers studied nearly 650 people whose average age was 66. 240 of those studied suffered from Alzheimer's, the most common form of mental decline . 391 of the _ spoke two or more languages. Researchers found the dementias began about four-and-a-half years later in those who spoke two languages compared to those who spoke only one language. The level of education had no effect on the age at the first sign of dementia.\nThomas Bak, from the Center of Cognitive Aging at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who helped to organize the study, suggests that individuals who speak more than one language train their brains by moving back and forth between different words and expressions. He also believes this effort improves what scientists called executive  functioning, which often weakens in people with dementias. He states that researchers found there was no extra gain in speaking more than two languages.\nMr Bak says it does not appear important whether you learn another language at a young age or later in life. It's not something that \"you missed the boat when you do not do it as a baby.\" It is something that is still quite useful and powerful when you do it as an adult.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Reporting verbs", "topic_category": "reported_speech"}

Learn how to look good and look natural in your yearbook photo with these simple tips.\n1. Practice smiling in a mirror. It sounds crazy, but figuring out how to make a natural looking smile for the camera does need a little preparation. Don't be shy! Just imagine you are in front of a camera --hold your head high, look straight into the mirror and smile. Keep practicing until you find out your most attractive smiling face.\n2. Choose your color wisely. In yearbook photos, lots of people look good in darker colors because they draw attention to the face. Generally, white often isn't the best choice because it can make your skin look a bit gray, especially if you're pale. Besides, stay away from super -bright colors ( bright yellow, bright blue) unless you're really sure they make you look perfect.\n3. Avoid unnecessary details. Busy patterns draw attention to themselves in yearbook photos, not to your face and smile. Save them for your everyday fashion experiments. Besides, have your clothes prepared for the day when the yearbook photo is taken. The last thing you want to do is pick out the perfect thing to wear, only to find that it's in the laundry.\n4. Avoid big changes to your appearance. Big changes may not turn out the way you hope. Leave some time to do your hair, such as combing  it up right before the yearbook photo is taken. Don't overdo it, since you want your hair to stay in one place and your face to draw all the attention, but go for the \"less is more\" approach.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Verb patterns (advise sb to…, make/let + bare inf…)", "topic_category": "gerunds_infinitives"}

Students should be allowed to study without worrying about grades. Fortunately, most educators are becoming aware of the fact that students have different interests and abilities.

Grades perform three basic functions. First, grades motivate students to work at their highest level of competence. Second, they act as a reward for hardworking students and as a punishment to students who do not work hard. Finally, grades are used as an effective standard by which to measure student achievement. Good grades help students to get jobs and to get into university.
