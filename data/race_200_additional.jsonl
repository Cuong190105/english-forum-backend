Since it touches almost every field of our life, educated people need at least some knowledge with its structure and operation. They should also have an understanding of the scientific subculture in which scientists live and the kinds of people they are. An understanding of general characteristics of science as well as specific scientific ideas is easier to obtain if one knows something about the things that excite and discourage the scientist.\n    This book is written for the person whose knowledge with science is not complete; for the person who has been presented with science as a musty storehouse of dried facts; for the person who sees the chief objective of science as the production of tricks; and for the person who views the scientists as some sort of magician. The book can be used to add to a course in any science, to come with any course that attempts to give an understanding of the modern world, or simply to provide a better understanding of science. We hope this book will lead readers to a broader view on scientific attitudes and a more realistic view of what science is, who scientists are, and what they do. It will give them an idea and understanding of the relationship between science and our culture and an appreciation of the roles science may play in our culture. Besides, readers may learn to appreciate the relationship between scientific views and some of the values and philosophies that are deep in our culture.\n We have tried to present in this book a correct and up-to-date picture of the scientific world and the people who populate it. That population has in recent years come to include more and more women. This increasing role of women is not just the only event but, rather, part of the trend obvious in all parts of society, as more women enter traditionally male-controlled fields and make influential contributions.\n We have also tried to make the book entertaining as well as informative.

Before then I had done bits of reviewing--novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff.\nAt first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable.\nIt all felt like a bit of dream at that time: a new newspaper and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence.\nTom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film.\nThe space I am given allows me to broaden my argument--or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie.

Many young people get through the troubled years of adolescence and emerge into adulthood reasonably safe and sound. Too many youngsters, however, feel confused and ignored. Unable to climb out of the dilemma, these youngsters are socially and emotionally \"at-risk\". They may suffer from such painful symptoms as anxiety, depression or anger.\nMany parents, in an honest attempt to help their adolescent from emotionally drowning, seek professional treatment. They put a great deal of faith in professional clinicians to find a way out for their child. However, many of these parents begin to recognize that solving the problem is more complex than they had initially realized. It has been my clinical experience that some parents who bring their resistant youngster for treatment see their child as being solely responsible for the problem. In many cases, the adolescent feels angry and defective for being pushed into treatment. \nWe can gain some insight if we look at things through the eyes of the adolescent. The child is usually reluctantly brought by the parents to clinicians as what I call the \"identified patient\". The youngster waits anxiously as the parents lay out the problem with the clinicians with remarks such as, \"I don't know what's happening to my child lately, but he's not his old self. He doesn't listen to me anymore, has been getting failing grades, acts out at school, and stays in his room all the time.'' Such descriptions at the beginning of treatment by the parents may strengthen feelings of incompetence on the part of the child. Such a pattern at the beginning sets up an intention of resistance and leaves the potential for a positive outcome at risk.\nWhat many parents fail to realize is that the adolescent's problem serves as a symbol for what is happening within the family system. Unknowingly, a youngster may become rebellious or depressed as a way of attempting to calm the psychic pain experienced by his family. To some degree, the child's behavioral problems represent an effort to distract attention away from the unstable state within his family. In such cases it represents a courageous attempt by the teen to minimize home-related problems. Eventually the problems become too troublesome for the child and he continues to sacrifice himself for the sake of the family. Many times youngsters go to clinicians in the hope that treatment will aid in healing the entire family system.\nIn my clinical experience, I have found that the troubled adolescent is more likely to find emotional healing if the parents are actively involved in the treatment process. In such cases where family members are involved in treatment, the adolescent's expectation for change tends to improve. With parental involvement, the teen begins to feel more competent, as other family members take the risk to explore difficult family issues.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Zero gravity makes this everyday task quite a challenge. Astronauts have to be toilet-trained all over again.\nThe Apollo astronauts raised themselves off the seat of their chairs and stuck a clear plastic bag to their back sides with sticky strips. A second astronaut watched closely to be sure no waste matter escaped the seal. (You would not want that stuff floating around the cabin!) When the deed was done, the astronaut cleaned up with a piece of plastic attached to the inside of the bag, removed the bag, dropped a disinfectant pill in with the waste matter, and put the whole thing, sealed, into a special container.\nDonald W. Rethke, an engineer for Hamilton Standard Space Systems, developed a more private way to answer nature's call: the space toilet. It is somewhat like the kind of toilet one would find on commercial airplanes --- with unique adaptations for zero gravity, of course. For instance, it has thigh bars that keep the astronaut from floating off the seat.\nThe astronaut (male or female) defecates   in a bag and urinates   in a hose. Solid and liquid wastes are kept separated because at least 85% of the urine is recycled and, yes, after careful filtration, used for drinking and other purposes. (Water is always in demand in space.) A vacuum sucks the waste materials into the toilet, where the waste is compacted into hamburger-like patties for easy storage.

Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office.

Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it, and only 35 percent say it's tolerated.\nSkeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced   by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \"working\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner.\nIt is true, however, that working at home makes people much more efficient  , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush.\nThe fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker.\nMore broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who haven't worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home.

In addition, fences or walls should extend out from either side of a tunnel for about 30 meters, which guide amphibians toward the tunnels. \nEuropean countries have built amphibian tunnels for decades.

In most years, more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease, although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or workplace can remain unaffected for long.\nMalaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by an intense fever and, often, headaches. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. Malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect. They can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can happen again and again for years. The disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite. Together, the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control. Studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently, and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations. Some of the disease's spread is due to global warming.\nFor decades, the first-choice treatment for malaria parasites in Africa has been chloroquine, a chemical which is very cheap and easy to make.

Applying those standards,the greenest place in America is New York City-- particularly,the overcrowded,overpriced island of Manhattan, which produces 30% less per-capita greenhouse gas than that of the nation.\nIt's that density that makes Manhattan so green. Manhattan's population density is 800 times the national average. Density comes with negatives,certainly-- small living spaces,air pollution-- but it also enables amazing efficiencies.Over 80% of Manhattanites travel to work by public transport, by bike or on foot-- compared to an average of about 8% everywhere else in the country. Manhattan's apartment buildings are far more energy-efficient than the houses in the suburbs.\nWhat's true of New York City is more or less true of other American urban areas, which explains why a growing part of the environmental movement now focuses on greening cities, hoping to attract more Americans back downtown. There's an effort to make cities more sustainable ,by improving public transport,reducing air pollution and upgrading energy efficiency. But even more important, it is quite urgent to change decades of government policies that have been in favor of the suburbs,with disastrous consequences for energy,the environment and the climate.\nThat's exactly the difficult point.

The hydrogen and oxygen gases are then stored in a fuel cell,which uses those two materials to produce electricity,located either on top of a house or beside the house.\nThough the leaf is only about the shape of a poker card,scientists claimed that it is promising to be an inexpensive source of electricity in developing countries. \"One can imagine villages in India and Africa not long from now purchasing an affordable basic power system based on this technology,\" said Nocera at a conference of the American Chemical Society.\nThe artificial leaf is not a new idea. The first artificial leaf was invented in 1997 but was too expensive and unstable for practical use. The new leaf,by contrast,is made of cheap materials,easy to use and highly stable. In laboratory studies,Nocera showed that an artificial leaf prototype   could operate continuously for at least 45 hours without a drop in activity.\nThe wonderful improvements come from Nocera's recent discovery of several powerful,new and inexpensive catalysts. These catalysts make the energy transformation inside the leaf more efficient with water and sunlight. Right now,the new leaf is about 10 times more efficient at carrying out photosynthesis than a natural one. Besides,the device can run in whatever water is available;that is,it doesn't need pure water. This is important for some countries that don't have access to pure water.\nWith the goal to \"make each home its own power station\" and \"give energy to the poor\",scientists believe that the new technology could be widely used in developing countries,especially in India and rural China.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Holiday eaters were urged to \"clean their plates\" and were asked to take leftover food home in \"doggy bags.\"\nThe impetus behind the campaign was the startling government statistic that over 200 billion yuan is spent every year on food that ends up in the garbage bin. And in the midst of all this waste, statistics show that 128 million people are living below the poverty line and going hungry.\nThe \"clean your plate\" campaign is part of a worldwide effort to stop precious food from being wasted. The United Nations estimates that $1trillion (yes, that's a very big number) worth of food is wasted each year. Most of that is lost during food production and transportation, but a significant percentage is attributed to waste by consumers. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has launched a campaign called \"Think. Eat. Save.\" to make people aware of the problem.\nChinese actress Fan Bingbing is an ambassador for UNEP and she encouraged people to upload pictures of their \"clean plates\" to show their support for the program. Thousands of people responded and demonstrated that they had a clear conscience to go along with their full stomachs.\nXi Jinping, the incoming Chinese president, is also urging people to be less wasteful and he told Party members to cut back on extravagant holiday banquets and to be more careful when spending the people's money.\nFor some, though, Xi Jinping's and Fan Bingbing's admonitions don't go far enough. Yuan Longping, an agricultural scientist, caused a stir by saying that wasting food should be treated as a crime.

Its new moniker , Denali, was actually its original Aleut name, meaning \"the high one\". The previous name, on the other hand, only dates back to 1896--the year when it was named in honour of William McKinley(1843--1901), who was shortly to become President of the United States. Denali is of course not the only mountain with an interesting linguistic history, so let's travel to Asia, and across Europe, to explore the naming of those continents' most famous peaks and mountain ranges.\nThe Nepalese name Himalaya comes from a Sanskrit word meaning \"Abode of Snow\", from hima for \"snow\" and alaya for \"abode\". In Buddhist sources, Himalaya is known by various names such as Himava and Himavanta.\nIn 1856, Mount Everest was named after Sir George Everest (1790--1866), who was the superintendent  of the Trigonometrical Survey of India. Everest himself was initially displeased by the naming, since he feared that local inhabitants might not be able to pronounce it.\nK2 stands for Karakoram 2, because it was the second peak to be surveyed in the Trigonometrical Survey in the Karakoram system. It was also formerly known as Mount Godwin Austen after Col. H. H. Godwin Austen, who first surveyed it. Another alternative name for the mountain is Chhogori.\nAnnapurna is a household Goddess for Hindus, who guarantees to her worshippers  that food will not fail. The name derives from a Sanskrit word meaning \"one who gives nourishment\".\nThe Matterhorn's name derives from the name of the nearby town of Zermatt, the second element of which is apparently Matte \"meadow\", and Horn, \"horn\". Horn is not an unusual element in German names of mountains with jutting peaks. The mountain is called Mont Cervin in French and Monte Cervino in Italian, from the Italian adjective cervino \"deer-like\", which conjures up  a deer's antlers.\nBen Nevis is the Anglicized form of the Scottish Gaelic name Beinn Nibheis, which means\"Mountain by the(River)Nevis\".

Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine   if you know that your friends drink it.\nYou should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them.\nTry to be free at the dinner table. If you don't know about choosing the right fork or knife, just watch the other people, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, ask the person next to you.\nIf you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank them for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a thank-you card the day after.\nRose", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Mathilda's school, like most schools in the area, doesn't have access to clean water and sanitation facilities for its students. So instead of spending their whole school day learning, Mathilda and her classmates start their day by spending two hours to the closest river fetching water ---water that is anyway most likely not safe to drink. They do the same thing again in the afternoon, so they often lose around half of their school day fetching water.\nMathilda has to do the same thing outside of school hours to get the water her family needs at home, leaving her little time for studying. Because of rising temperatures, water has become harder and harder to find here, and people have to spend more and more time trying to find it.\nThis is just one small example of how climate change is making it harder to realize people's rights to water, education and security. Unfortunately, most higher-income countries remained silent on the issue.\nThis is despite studies showing that communities already facing marginalization ,such as women and children, mostly suffer from climate change. This is especially the case for those in countries with limited resources and fragile ecosystems.\nMeanwhile, women consist of the majority of the world 's poor,and so are more dependent for their livelihood on natural resources that are threatened by climate change. And around the world, women and girls are the most likely to be responsible for fetching water for their families.\nThis exposes them to danger and leaves them with less time to attend school, earn money, or simply to rest. But the fact is that the effects of climate change will be felt globally.\nDespite the difficulties she is facing, trying to get an education, Mathilda says she hopes to serve her community in a leadership role when she grows up.\n\"All of the world's leaders need to work together to solve this problem that we are all facing,\" she said.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Researchers at Australia's Monash University have found actual difference in the brains of people who respond emotionally to others' feelings compared with those who respond more rationally.\nA study published in the journal NeuroImage has looked at whether people who have more brain cells in certain areas of the brain are better at certain types of empathy, according to Science Daily. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person, and the two types investigated were cognitive   empathy and affective   empathy.\n\"Every day people use empathy with, and without, their knowledge to get around in the social world,\" said Robert Eres from Monash University's School of Psychological Sciences. \"We use it for communication, to build relationships, and to increase our understanding of others.\"\n\"People who are high on affective empathy are often those who get quite fearful when watching a scary movie, or start crying during a sad scene. Those who have high cognitive empathy are those who are more rational, for example a psychologist helping someone,\" explained Eres.\nThe results of the study showed that people with high scores for affective empathy had more gray matter in a part of the brain called the insula, found right in the \"middle\" of the brain. Those who scored higher for cognitive empathy had more in a part called the midcingulate cortex--an area above the corpus callosum, which connects the two halves of the brain.\nThe discovery \"raises new questions--like whether people could train themselves to have more empathy, and whether those areas of the brain would become larger if they did, or whether we can lose our ability to empathize if we don't use it enough\", according to Science Daily.\n\"In the future we want to investigate further by testing whether training people in empathy-related tasks can lead to changes in these brain areas. We also want to investigate if damage to these brain areas, as a result of a stroke   for example, can lead to empathy problems.\" said Eres.\nPerhaps in the future we will all be able to empathize more with other people.

Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West.\nHorace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. Then he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\" he said.\nAs it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco. It was his custom to \" _ \" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \"grub\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value.\nFinally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \"grub\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took $17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \"Pittsburgh Mine,\" made $1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his $17 investment.\nLater Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for $117,000. This turned out to be even more fabulous than the Pittsburgh, yielding $35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew. Tabor became its first mayor, and later became lieutenant governor of the state.", "split": "train", "level": ""}
{"id": "high17053.txt", "source_text": "A language holiday is a combination of \"holiday\" and study abroad to learn or improve a foreign language. English language holidays are taken in English-speaking countries like England, the USA or Australia. While there, you study in a language school with students from many different countries. You live with local people, often staying with a host family. A language holiday can be of any length - from one week to one year - but most are two or three weeks.\nWhat are the Benefits of a Language Holiday?\nLanguage holidays have become a very popular method of learning English because they have many advantages:\nTotal Exposure  Because you are in an English-speaking country, you are constantly exposed to English from the time you wake up and have breakfast with your host family until late evening and your last drink in a local pub. You have little or no opportunity to escape the English language. This is how you learn your own language - constant exposure.\nMixed Classes   When you study in your own country, all the other students in your class speak your language, so you are not forced to use English. On a language holiday, students come from countries all over the world. It is possible that nobody in your class will speak your language, so you will just have to speak English!\nFreedom From Pressure   On a language holiday you are away from home and can forget the everyday pressures of school or business. Your mind is more relaxed and you can learn more easily.\nCultural Understanding   Learning a language is not only about learning words. Different nations have different cultures. People think and behave differently. Their language is closely associated with their culture. By visiting and living in a foreign country, you learn to understand the culture and the people - and so better understand the language.\nYou'll find schools offering language holidays at EnglishClub.com ESL World.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Several other bear reports have come from Citrus County.\n\" It is really difficult for the younger bears to find their own land around here, \" said Niki Everitt, bear hot line director for the Gulf Coast Conservancy.\nBrooksville's bear first was spotted late Thursday crossing State Road 50, headed toward Tom Varn Park.

An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China.\nMilu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties  did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China.\nLuckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province.\nThe deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province. At the moment the Milu deer live in centres where they are being well protected and cared for.

Generally speaking, men do one thing at a time. Women do many. Doing many things at one time is often called \"multi-tasking,\" a very popular word these days.\nNow scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains. A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along--men and women think differently.\nScientists at the University of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from 8 to 22 years old. They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain, or hemisphere. In the female brain, they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain. The left side of the brain is known as the side of \"reason\". The right hemisphere is known as the \"creative\" side.\nRegina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She co-wrote the report. She says when women are asked to do something complicated they might use different parts of the brain. But men generally use just one.\nAs a result, men generally deal directly with a problem. There is a strong connection between the \"understanding\" and the \"action\" parts of their brains. Women, however, might include other parts of the brain, like the part connected with \"reason\" and the part connected with sensitivity when solving a problem.

Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen.\nOur calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift  about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20.\nCaesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days.\nIn 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \"00\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar.

I did this several years ago, though I wasn't actively looking for a different job.\nIn 2007, I was hired at the Transamerica Life Insurance Company, as a customer service representative in the distributions services department. I processed requests for distributions from our annuity policy holders around the country. Someone might have forgotten to sign a form, for example, or might have omitted security information. To solve the problem, I'd mail the person a letter.\nThe company had been through several combinations, so in our department alone we had a collection of about 140 templates  for letters related to distributions. The longer I worked with the letters, the more I saw how they could be improved. Some had overlapping information and could be combined. Some had incorrect grammar or needed updating. I also noticed that industry terminology  wasn't standard across all the versions.\nWhen I told my department supervisor about this in 2008, she agreed that the letters needed _ . She said I should stop what I'd been doing and start the new work. In a relatively short time, I was able to make numerous improvements and reduce the number of letters to 70. It was an informal job change until a managers' meeting several months later.\nAt that meeting, a vice president who was unaware of my new work mentioned that the division's entire stock of 1,700 letters should be reviewed. My manager told her that she knew the perfect person for the job--me. The position was still considered temporary when I took on the extra tasks, but I was able to show that the work had value, and I was officially promoted and given a raise in November 2009.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Then the school's hard-driving headmaster, Delores Bolton, persuaded her board to shake up the place by buying a laptop computer for each student and teacher to use, in school and at home. What's more, the board provided wireless Internet access at school. Total cost: $2.5 million.\nNow, an hour before classes start, every seat in the library is taken by students who cannot wait for getting online. Fifth-grade teacher Jen Friday talks about different kinds of birds as students view them at a colorful website. After school, students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework. Since the computer arrived, enrollment is up 20%. Scores on state tests are up 35%.\nIndeed, school systems in rural Maine and New York City also hope to follow Arace Middle School's example. Governor Angus King had planned using $50 million to buy a laptop for all of Maine's 17,000 seventh-graders - and for new seventh-graders each fall.\nIn the same spirit, the New York City board of education voted on April 12 to create a school Internet portal , which would make money by selling ads and licensing public school students. Profits will also provide e-mail service for the city's 1.1 million public school students. Profits will be used to buy laptops for each of the school system's 87,000 fourth-graders. Within nine years, all students in grades 4 and higher will have their own computers.\nBack in Bloomfield, in the meantime, most of the _ have been worked out.

He gave us an example of the process by which pins were made in England.\n    One man draws out the wire, another strengthens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, and a fifth gives it a head. Just to make the head requires two or three different operations. The work of making pins is divided into about eighteen different operations, which in some factories are all performed by different people, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them.\n    Ten men, Smith said, in this way, turned out twelve pounds of pins a day or about 4,800 pins a worker. But if all of them had worked separately and independently without division of labor, they certainly could not have made twenty pins in a day and not even one.\n    There can be no doubt that division of labor is an efficient way of organizing work.  Fewer people can make more pins. Adam Smith saw this, but he also took it for granted that the division of labor is itself responsible for economic growth and development and it accounts for the difference between expanding economies and those that stand still. In fact, the division of labor adds nothing new, and it only enables people to produce more of what they already have.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

Fatty fast-food diets combined with the lifestyles with televisions and computers could mean kids will die young, says Professor Andrew Prentice, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. At the same time, the shape of the human body is going through a great change because adults are getting so fat.\nHere in Britain, the latest research shows that the average waist size for a man is 36~38 inches and may be 42~44 inches by 2032.This compares with only 32.6 inches in 1972. Women's waists have grown from an average of 22 inches in the 1920s to 24 inches in the 1950s and 30 inches now. One of the major reasons why children now are at greater risk is that we are getting fatter younger. In the UK alone, more than one million under 16 years old are thought\nto be overweight or fat--double the number in the 1980s. One in ten of four-year-olds are also medically said to be obese.\nThe obesity which started in the US, has now spread to Europe, Australia, Central America and the Middle East. Many nations now record more than 20 percent of their population as obese and well over half of the population as overweight.\nProfessor Prentice says the change in our shape has been caused by high-energy foods combined with a dramatic   drop in the energy we use as a result of technology developments.\nHe is not alone in his concern. Only last week one medical magazine revealed how obesity was fuelling a rise in cancer cases. Obesity also increases the risk factor for heart disease and so on. An averagely obese person's lifespan   is shortened by around nine years while a seriously obese person by much more.\nProfessor Prentice says,\n\"So _ will _ parents _ live _ longer _ than _ their _ children, _ as _ an _ American _ obesity _ expert _ said _ recently?\"\n\"The answer is yes--and no.\" Yes, when most children become obese.

Your teacher knows that, and in most cases, he or she is thrilled to be the person who's giving you all that material and helping you put it together. Remember, teachers are people, too, and they feel great if you're open to what they're teaching you. That's why they wanted to be teachers in the first place to teach!\nSome kids may be able to learn in any situation, whether they like the teacher or not. But most kids are sensitive to the way they get along with the teacher, and if things aren't going well, they won't learn as well and won't enjoy being in class.", "split": "test", "level": ""}
{"id": "high6149.txt", "source_text": "Car Talk\nWhen I got the driving license last summer, Mom and I took our first trip around an empty parking lot. Then I found that my mother was not the best teacher for me. It wasn't that she shouted, or told me that I was doing poorly. As you can imagine, my mother's \"helpful instructions\" only managed to make me more nervous.\nSince I could no longer practice with her, the job was placed in the hands of my father. The idea of learning from Dad was not one that thrilled me. I loved him dearly, but I just did not see Dad as someone I could be comfortable learning from. He almost never talked. We shared a typical father-daughter relationship. He'd ask how school was, and I'd say it was fine. Unfortunately, that was the most of our conversations. Spending hours alone with someone who might as well have been a stranger really scared me.\nAs we got into the car that first time, I was not surprised at what happened. Dad and I drove around, saying almost nothing, aside from a few instructions on how to turn. As my lessons went on, however, things began to change. Dad would turn the radio up so I could fully appreciate his favorite Stones music. And he actually began talking. I was soon hearing about past failed dates, \"basic body\" gym class, and other tales from his past, including some of his first meeting with Mom.\nDad' s sudden chattiness was shocking until I thought about why he was telling me so much in the car. In all the years that I had wondered why my father never spoke that much, I had never stopped to consider that it was because I had never bothered to listen. Homework, friends, and even TV had all called me away from him, and, consequently, I never thought my quiet father had anything to say.\nSince I began driving with him, my driving skill has greatly increased. More important, though, is that my knowledge of who my father is has also increased. Just living with him wasn't enough--it took driving with him for me to get to know someone who was a mystery.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

States did require each town to provide a school for children, but teachers were often poorly prepared. Most young women were not able to continue on with their education in private schools. If they did, they often were not taught much except the French language, how to sew   clothing, and music.\nMary Lyon felt that women's education was extremely important. Through her lifelong work for education she became the most famous woman in the 19th century America. She believed that women were teachers both at home and in the classroom. And she believed that efforts to better educate young women also served God. If women were better educated, she felt, they could teach in local schools throughout the United States and in foreign countries.\nIn 1837, Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke Seminary for Women. Only four teachers and the first class of eighty young women lived and studied in the building when the school opened. But Mary knew the importance of what had been established   -- the first independent school for the higher education of women. The school continued to grow. In 1893, under a state law, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary became a college. Mount Holyoke College was the first college to offer women the same education as was offered to men.\nPeople who have studied Mary Lyon say she was not fighting a battle   of equality between men and women, yet she knew she wanted more for women. Her efforts led to the spread of higher education for women in the United States.

Smart home technology is a way for ordinary electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, consumers, and even manufacturers. Many consider a smart home to be one that is networked. Others feel it is a home that has appliances that will allow the consumer to do little or no work, but a smart home really is all of that combined, and more. Not only will all consumer products be networked, but they will also make life easier and more entertaining. Smart home technology is currently being developed and carried out for all rooms in the house, in particular the kitchen and the living room.\n  Many of today's products are becoming \"smart.\" Kitchen refrigerators, microwaves, and stoves are using this technology. Even washers and dryers have the technology today to be more automated  to fit people's needs. Products in the bathroom will even start to use smart home technology.

Of course he helped set the trend, so that got me thinking about the link between films and trends in fashion. Fashion and films have gone hand in hand for long. The Wild One is a good example: it appeared in 1954, starring Brando. Dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket, leather cap and jeans, he created a look which is still considered \"cool\" today. Everyone from Madonna to middle-aged men is seen wearing the classic leather motorcycle jacket.\nAnother strong influence on fashion trends was Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn. She made famous the simple black dress that looks perfect at either a cocktail party or just standing around an expensive department store like Tiffany's with a pastry and coffee in your hand, as Audrey Hepburn does in the film. She looks so elegant, wearing simple but beautiful dresses, big dark glasses and a string of pearls around her neck. Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \"Tiffany's look\".\nIn more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994. Her style was very simple. Her black trousers, crisp white shirt and hair style was copied by women in the world.\nInfluencing fashion trends can often be about timing. The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \"geisha trips\" to Japan. The film has also led to a regained interest in kimonos. It is now quite common to see young Japanese women wearing kimonos not just on traditional occasions, but at various social events.

Women seem to be better able to deal with stress than men are. However, experts say women are three times more likely to develop depression in reaction to the stress in their lives. American writer John Gray became famous for his book, \"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.\" He notes that men and women have opposite ways of dealing with stress. For a man, the best way is to rest and forget about daily problems. But a woman suffering from stress needs to talk about her problems.\nExperts say there are several ways to deal with stress, including deep breathing, exercise, eating healthy foods, getting enough rest and balancing the time spent working and playing. Exercise is one of the most effective stress-reduction measures, as physical changes from exercise make you feel better. In addition, exercise can also improve the body's defense system against disease.\nKeeping stress to yourself can make problems worse. Experts say that expressing emotions to friends or family members or writing down your feelings can help reduce stress. And they also suggest that people should attempt to accept or change stressful situations whenever possible.", "split": "train", "level": ""}

So I decided to learn English.\nI went to Mrs Brown's English class. Before I came to the class, I always walked away when I met any Americans. But now I try to talk to Americans in English. And I like going to supermarkets, cafes and restaurants to talk with local people.\nI learn English in four ways. First , I listen to the teacher carefully and keep speaking in class. Second, I do my homework after I get home. I learn at least five words every day. Third, I listen to American radio and watch American TV programs. Finally, I surf the Internet to talk with different people in English.\nTo learn English well, I think you must learn to open your mouth. For me that is the key to opening the door of learning English.", "split": "train", "level": ""}
{"id": "high21877.txt", "source_text": "A young girl decided to study judo despite the fact that she had lost her left arm in a car accident. The girl began lessons with an old Japanese judo instructor. The girl was doing well. So she couldn't understand why, after three months of training, the instructor had taught her only one move. \n\"Instructor,\" the girl finally said, \"Shouldn't I be learning more moves?\" \n\"This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,\" the instructor replied.  Not quite understanding, but believing in her teacher, the girl kept training. \nSeveral months later, the instructor took the girl to her first tournament . Surprising herself, the girl easily won her first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, her opponent became impatient. The girl used her one move to win the match. Still amazed by her success, the girl was now in the finals. \nThis time, her opponent  was bigger, stronger and more experienced. For a while, the girl appeared to be overmatched. Concerned that the girl might get hurt, the referee  called a time-out . She was about to stop the match when the instructor intervened .\n\"No,\" the instructor insisted, \"Let her continue.\" \nSoon after the match restarted, her opponent made an important mistake: she dropped her guard. Instantly, the girl used her move to defeat her opponent. The girl had won the match and the tournament. She was the champion.\nOn the way home, the girl and her teacher reviewed every move in each match. Then the girl asked what was really on her mind. \n\"Instructor, how did I win the tournament with only one move?\" \n\"You won for two reasons,\" the teacher answered. \"First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. Second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.\"", "split": "train", "level": ""}
