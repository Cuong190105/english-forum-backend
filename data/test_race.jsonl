{"id": "high7211.txt", "source_text": "A recent study of ancient and modern elephants has come up with the unexpected conclusion that the African elephant is divided into two distinct  species.\nThe discovery was made by researchers at York and Harvard Universities when they were examining the genetic relationship between the ancient woolly mammoth and mastodon to modern elephants -- the Asian elephant, African forest elephant, and African savanna elephant.\nOnce they obtained DNA sequences  from two fossils , mammoths,and mastodons the team compared them with DNA from modern elephants. They found to their amazement that modern forest and savanna elephants are as distinct from each other as Asian elephants and mammoths.\nThe scientists used detailed genetic analysis to prove that the African savanna elephant and the African forest elephant have been distinct species for several million years. The divergence of the two species took place around the time of the divergence of Asian elephants and woolly mammoths. This result amazed all the scientists. There has long been debate in the scientific community that the two might be separate species, but this is the most convincing scientific evidence so far that they are indeed different species.\nPreviously, many naturalists believed that African savanna elephants and African forest elephants were two populations of the same species, despite the elephants' significant size differences. The savanna elephant has an average shoulder height of 3.5 metres while the forest elephant has an average shoulder height of 2.5 metres. The savanna elephant weighs between six and seven tons, roughly double the weight of the forest elephant. But the fact that they look so different does not necessarily mean they are different species. However the proof lay in the analysis of the DNA.\nAlfred Roca, assistant professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois, said, \"We now have to treat the forest and savanna elephants as two different units for conservation purposes. Since 1950,all African elephants have been conserved as one species. Now that we know the forest and savanna elephants are two very distinctive animals, the forest elephant should become a bigger priority  for conservation purposes.\"", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Past Simple", "topic_category": "tenses_aspects"}

I am moved to show how aging feels to me physically and mentally. Getting older. of course, is obviously a better change than the one that brings you eulogies . In fact, a poet named Robert Browning considered it the best change of all:\nGrow old along with me!\nThe best is yet to me.\nWhether or not Browning was right, most of my first fifty years have been golden ones, so I will settle for what is ahead being as good as what has gone by.

{"id": "high19035.txt", "source_text": "With little rain, ancient Egyptians relied mostly on the Nile River to water their crops, so they could only grow certain kinds of food. They mainly grew wheat and barley  .\nThe Egyptians made the wheat into bread, soup and porridge, and they also added hops   to make the barley into beer. In fact, some people think that the Egyptians would not have begun growing grain if they hadn't liked beer so much. Many Egyptian models of beer jars have been found, which the Egyptians put into graves of dead people so that they would have beer in the next world.\nThe Egyptians also ate meat. They went to a butcher shop and bought meat there, just as people do today. But because it rarely rains in Egypt, they could have the meat outside in the yard of the store instead of inside. Click on the left and you will see a model of a butcher shop, which was also found in somebody's grave. Can you see the different cuts of meat all laid out? There is a whole leg of mutton at the very bottom. However, Egyptians thought pigs carried infectious disease. They ate beef, mutton, duck and goose. \nFor dessert, the Egyptians had a great interest in dates. Here is a picture of some real Egyptian dates which were put into people's graves for them to eat in the next world, and which were kept in the dry climate for three thousand years until archaeologists dug them up.\nArchaeologists have also found seeds which show that the Egyptians grew watermelon and other kinds of melon.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Past Simple", "topic_category": "tenses_aspects"}

He took great care of her and gave her nothing but the best. \nHe also loved the 3rd wife very much. He's very proud of her and always wanted to show her off to his friends. However, the merchant is always in great fear that she might run away with some other men. \nHe too, loved his 2nd wife. She is a very considerate person, always patient and in fact is the merchant's confidante. When the merchant faced some problems, he always turned to his 2nd wife and she would always help him out and tide him through difficult times. \nNow, the merchant's 1st wife is a very loyal partner and has made great contributions in maintaining his wealth and business as well as taking care of the household. However, the merchant did not love the first wife and although she loved him deeply, he hardly took notice of her. \nOne day, the merchant fell ill. Before long, he knew that he was going to die soon. He thought of his luxurious life and told himself, \"Now I have 4 wives with me. But when I die, I'll be alone. How lonely I'll be!\" \nThus, he asked the 4th wife, \"I loved you most, endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over you. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?\" \n\"No way!\" replied the 4th wife and she turned away without another word. \nThe answer cut like a sharp knife right into the merchant's heart. The sad merchant then asked the 3rd wife, \"I have loved you so much for all my life. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?\"\n\"No!\" replied the 3rd wife. \"Life is so good over here! I'm going to remarry when you die!\" The merchant's heart sank and turned cold. \nHe then asked the 2nd wife, \"I've always turned to you for help and you've always helped me out. Now I need your help again. When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?\" \n\"I'm sorry, I can't help you out this time!\" replied the 2nd wife. \"At the very most, I can only send you to your grave.\" The answer came like a bolt of thunder and the merchant was devastated. \nThen a voice called out: \"I'll leave with you. I'll follow you no matter where you go.\" The merchant looked up and there was his first wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered from malnutrition. Greatly grieved, the merchant said, \"I should have taken much better care of you while I could have!\" \nActually, we all have 4 wives in our lives.\nThe 4th wife is our body. No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good, it'll leave us when we die. \nOur 3rd wife is our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, they all go to others. \nThe 2nd wife is our family and friends. No matter how close they had been there for us when we're alive, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave. \nThe 1st wife is in fact our soul, often neglected in our pursuit of material, wealth and sensual pleasure. \nGuess what? It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go. Perhaps it's a good idea to cultivate and strengthen it now rather than to wait until we're on our deathbed to lament.", "split": "train", "level": "", "topic": "Past Simple", "topic_category": "tenses_aspects"}
